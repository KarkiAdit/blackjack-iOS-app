# 🃏 Blackjack - Native iOS Application

A **simple, engaging Blackjack game** built with **SwiftUI** and the **MVVM** architecture. This project is a hands-on demonstration of how to effectively use SwiftUI with MVVM to create responsive, well-structured iOS applications.

While Blackjack doesn’t typically need API services, this app simulates one using JSON data that provides deck information, adding a layer of realism to the development process.
